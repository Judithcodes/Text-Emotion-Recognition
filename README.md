# Text-Emotion-Recognition

This repository contains code for training a Bi-Directional LSTM model for emotion recognition on tweets. 
It is a simple code implementation which goes through the process step-by-step, highlighting how to tokenize words, pad sequences, build the model, train the model and make predictions
Six different classes of emotions are classified in this problem. The image below is a confusion matrix showing the accuracy of the model.
